This is a simple wayfinder kiosk for an airline company. Feel free to use this in non-commercial way. 
I created this wayfinder web app especially for students out there who wants to see how a wayfinder kiosk works on malls, airports and other establishments.
I used html, php, css, javascsript on this for an easier approach and three js framework for the 3d animation.
I used tinkercad to created the 3d map obj with mtl. If you want to create a new 3d map i recommend tinkercad since it is free.
